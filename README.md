# Graphical user interface (GUI) for convolution neural network fit result visualisation of a microimaing vs histology study in meningiomas.
* This tool enables to visualize basic fitting results of the CNN network.
* This code was created as part of course Scientific Programming in Python and Fortran 7.5 hp during the PhD. The purpose of this exercise was to create own python modules, classes and UI.
* This code is not connected to an article but needs `summmary.mat` file from the repository [microimaging_vs_histology_in_meningeomas(https://github.com/jan-brabec/microimaging_vs_histology_in_meningeomas) in the folder `Step_e_Manuscript_figures`.
